# HackerRank

I wanted to A) refresh/retain my C++ and Python skills while building my website in PHP and B) Practice white-boarding (I can code on the spot with PHP cause I use it so often. The others, not so much.), and C) practice Algorithm. Since I am doing it already, may as well git it. 
Really simple stuff for now - I am just doing the 30 Day Challenge and Intros.
